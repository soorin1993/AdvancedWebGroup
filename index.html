		        <p>I went a frat party last Saturday hoping to meet my prince Charming. I mean there's 50 boys living in one house, how hard could this be?</p> 
		
		        <p>As I expected, frat bros are the most romantic boys in the word! I was immediately swept off my feet when one asked me if I wanted to take a Burnetts handle pull. </p>
		
		        <p>From the kindness of his heart, he even gave me the option of Strawberry Banana, Tropical Fruit, and Pink Lemonade. It was so sweet; I look a pull of them all.</p>
		
		        <p>Just the fact that he could afford 3 bottles of the finest and most luxurious vodka made me begin to think of the life this man could show me. I had to know his name. I asked and the answer made me melt- "Chad."</p>
		
				<p>But that's when I saw Todd. He was wearing nothing but a furry speedo, cowboy hat, with cowboy boots swinging around a 12 inch gold magic wand. That's when I remembered the last time I wanted to buy a 12 inch magic wand. They cost $2000 each. Todd was def richer.</p>
		        
		        <p> At that moment I knew I wanted Todd. I went up to him and he told me he got it from Diddy. </p>
		    
		        <p>Unsure if it was just me or all the burnetts going to my head, but the whole room turned into a set of a 2000's rap and hip hop music video. It was pretty hot. </p>
		
		        <p>I kept my eyes on Todd and his 12 inch funstick from the table I was twerking upon. Then 50 Cent approached and offered me a tab of "ratchet acid"- his own proprietary formula. I just couldn't say no. </p>
		        
		        <p>But THAT's when I saw Dick with a ham and cheese sandwich. I ran towards him and snatched the sandwich out of his hand, quickly eating it all before he could react</p>
		
		        <p>The only thing that was missing was the spicy ranch.</p>   
		
		        <p>That's when I slid to the kitchen to raid the fridge. The only thing in there was half a bottle of jager, a jar of pickles, some expired milk, and a tub of ice cream with a screwdriver in it. I said forget this and eyed the room for souvenirs to steal.</p>
		
		        <p> Todd walked in with Flava Flav by his side. I knew only one thing could make this moment perfect. And there it was, in Flav's beautiful arms- a gallon of  spicy ranch. And just in the nick of time (according to his clock), the acid kicked in. </p>
		        
		        <p>The next morning I woke up covered in spicy ranch with Flava Flav doing my dishes and 50 Cent vacuuming my floor. I #slayed.</p> 
		
		        <p> ...and that kids, is how I met your father.</p>
