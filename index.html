        <p>Hello world! This is HTML5 Boilerplate.</p>
        
        <p>I went a frat party last Saturday hoping to meet my prince Charming. I mean there's 50 boys living in one house, how hard could this be?</p> 

        <p>As I expected, frat bros are the most romantic boys in the word! I was immediately swept off my feet when one asked me if I wanted to take a Burnetts handle pull. </p>

        <p>From the kindness of his heart, he even gave me the option of Strawberry Banana, Tropical Fruit, and Pink Lemonade. It was so sweet; I look a pull of them all.</p>

        <p>Just the fact that he could afford 3 bottles of the finest and most luxurious vodka made me begin to think of the life this man could show me. I had to know his name. I asked and the answer made me melt- "Chad."</p>

		p{But that's when I saw Todd. He was wearing nothing but a furry speedo, cowboy hat, with cowboy boots swinging around a 12 inch dildo. That's when I remembered the last time I wanted to buy a 12 inch dildo. They cost $2000 each. Todd was def richer.}
        
        <p> At that moment I knew I wanted Todd. I went up to him and he told me he got it from Diddy </p>
