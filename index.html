        <p>Hello world! This is HTML5 Boilerplate.</p>
        
        <p>I went a frat party last Saturday hoping to meet my prince Charming. I mean there's 50 boys living in one house, how hard could this be?</p> 
        <img src="prince.jpg" alt="prince" style="width:304px;height:228px;">

        <p>As I expected, frat bros are the most romantic boys in the word! I was immediately swept off my feet when one asked me if I wanted to take a Burnetts handle pull. </p>
        <img src="frat.jpg" alt="frat" style="width:304px;height:228px;">

        <p>From the kindness of his heart, he even gave me the option of Strawberry Banana, Tropical Fruit, and Pink Lemonade. It was so sweet; I look a pull of them all.</p>
        <img src="burnettes.png" alt="burnettes" style="width:304px;height:228px;">

        <p>Just the fact that he could afford 3 bottles of the finest and most luxurious vodka made me begin to think of the life this man could show me. I had to know his name. I asked and the answer made me melt- <strong>"Chad."</strong></p>
        <img src="isabella.jpg" alt="hearteyes" style="width:304px;height:228px;">

		<p>But that's when I saw Todd. He was wearing nothing but a furry speedo, cowboy hat, with cowboy boots swinging around a 12 inch gold magic wand. That's when I remembered the last time I wanted to buy a 12 inch magic wand. They cost $2000 each. Todd was def richer.</p>
        <img src="cowboy.jpg" alt="cowboy" style="width:304px;height:228px;">
        
        <p> At that moment I knew I wanted Todd. I went up to him and he told me he got it from Diddy. </p>
        <img src="diddy.jpg" alt="diddy" style="width:304px;height:228px;">

        <p>Unsure if it was just me or all the burnetts going to my head, but the whole room turned into a set of a 2000's rap and hip hop music video. <i>It was pretty hot.</i></p>
        <img src="50drive.gif" alt="video" style="width:304px;height:228px;">

        <p>I kept my eyes on Todd and his 12 inch funstick from the table I was twerking upon. Then 50 Cent approached and offered me a tab of "ratchet acid"-<small> his own proprietary formula.</small> I just couldn't say no. </p>
        <img src="50smile.gif" alt="50cent" style="width:304px;height:228px;">

        <p>But THAT's when I saw Dick with a ham and cheese sandwich. I ran towards him and snatched the sandwich out of his hand, quickly eating it all before he could react</p>
        <img src="ham.jpg" alt="ham" style="width:304px;height:228px;">

        <p>The only thing that was missing was the <b>spicy ranch.</b></p>  
        <img src="spicyranch.jpg" alt="spicy ranch" style="width:304px;height:228px;">

        <p>That's when I slid to the kitchen to raid the fridge. The only thing in there was half a bottle of jager, a rotten banana, some expired milk, and a tub of ice cream with a screwdriver in it. I said forget this and eyed the room for souvenirs to steal.</p>
        <img src="fridge.jpg" alt="fridge" style="width:304px;height:228px;">

        <p> Todd walked in with Flava Flav by his side. I knew only one thing could make this moment perfect. And there it was, in Flav's beautiful arms- a gallon of  spicy ranch. And just in the nick of time <em>according to his clock)</em>em>, the acid kicked in. </p>
        <img src="flav.jpg" alt="flav" style="width:304px;height:228px;">
        
        <p>The next morning I woke up covered in spicy ranch with Flava Flav doing my dishes and 50 Cent vacuuming my floor. I felt like shit, but I knew I had myself a hell of a night and that I was a god dam <strong>rockstar.</strong></p>
